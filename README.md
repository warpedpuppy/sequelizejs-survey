Welcome!

In order to use this app, download it, then use your command line to go to the root directory and type in:

npm start

and then open your browser to

http://localhost:3000/

and the good times should roll.

**************************

SO IN CASE THE ABOVE WASN'T CLEAR, HERE IT IS IN ALL CAPS:

FIRST:  DOWNLOAD THE APP

SECOND: VIA A TERMINAL WINDOW (COMMAND LINE): 1) GO TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF THE APP; AND 2) TYPE IN: npm start

THIRD:  IN A BROWSER, OPEN: http://localhost:3000/

****************************

In order to spare you the burden of having to create multiple choice questions, I have a random question generator button on the admin page.

This app assumes that you are a new user every time you go to the 'answer questions!' page.  So you will always get all of the questions, asked in random order, when you hit that page.


**************************

original instructions:

Create a web app written in Node.JS using an Express based framework, SequelizeJS, and MySQL.

Use NPM to declare all dependencies so that we can run it in a test environment.

The app should allow an admin to enter survey questions with multiple choice answers.

When a guest visits the app in a browser it should present a random survey question to the guest and allow them to answer.

Record answers and display the survey results in an admin interface.

Avoid showing a previously answered question to the same guest.

Make sure the UI is mobile browser friendly.

Provide a clear README with instructions on how to setup and run the app.
Create a github.com repository with the app that we can pull from and test.
