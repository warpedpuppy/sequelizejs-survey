Welcome!

In order to use this app, download it, then use your command line to go to the root directory and type in:

./bin/www

and then open your browser to

http://localhost:3000/

and the good times should roll.

**************************

SO IN CASE THE ABOVE WASN'T CLEAR, HERE IT IS IN ALL CAPS:

FIRST:  DOWNLOAD THE APP

SECOND: VIA A TERMINAL WINDOW (COMMAND LINE): 1) GO TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF THE APP; AND 2) TYPE IN: ./bin/www

THIRD:  IN A BROWSER, OPEN: http://localhost:3000/

In order to spare you the burden of having to create multiple choice questions, I have a random question generator button on the admin page.

This app assumes that you are a new user every time you go to the 'answer questions!' page.  So you will always get all of the questions, asked in random order, when you hit that page.
