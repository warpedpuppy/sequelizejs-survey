Welcome!

In order to see this app, first you must fill in the information in the config file (/config/config.json).  This is very important.  The program will create two tables on whatever database you specify in the config file, called "answers_ew_tests" and "question_ew_tests". Just letting you know this so you can delete them when you are done.

Then if you just use your command line to go to the root directory of the app, and type in:

./bin/www

and then open your browser to

http://localhost:3000/

and the good times should roll.

**************************

SO IN CASE THE ABOVE WASN'T CLEAR, HERE IT IS IN ALL CAPS:

FIRST:  FILL IN THE DATA IN /config/config.json

SECOND: IN TERMINAL (OR COMMAND LINE (?) ON A PC) GO TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF THE APP AND TYPE IN: ./bin/www

THIRD:  IN A BROWSER, OPEN: http://localhost:3000/

In order to spare you the burden of having to create multiple choice questions, I have a random question generator button on the admin page.
